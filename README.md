## üìö Project Roadmap

### 1. ‚úÖ **Project 1: S3 Static Website Hosting**  

In this project, we build a **static website** hosted on **Amazon S3**, accessible via a public endpoint.

#### **1.1 Create your S3 Static Website**
*Reference [Enabling website hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/EnableWebsiteHosting.html).*

1. **Access the S3 Console**
   - Sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).
   - In the left navigation pane, choose **General purpose buckets**.

2. **Create Your Bucket**
   - Give your bucket a uniq name and create it with **Default** values, do not change anything for now. 

3. **Once the bucket is created Enable Static Website Hosting**
   - Go to the **Properties** tab.
   - Under **Static website hosting**, choose **Edit**.
   - Select **Use this bucket to host a website**.
   - Under **Static website hosting**, toggle **Enable**.

4. **Configure Index and Error Documents**
   - **Index Document:** Enter the file name of the index document, typically `index.html`.  
   - **Error Document (Optional):** Enter the name of your custom error page, typically `error.html`.  

5. **Upload your Index file and Error file into your bucket**
   - *Example index.html, error.html file links [Configuring an index document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/IndexDocumentSupport.htmll).*

#### **1.2 Setting permissions for website access**
*Reference [Blocking public access to S3 storage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/access-control-block-public-access.html).*

By default, Amazon S3 blocks public access to your account and buckets. To host a static website, you must adjust these settings:

1. Sign in to the [Amazon S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).
2. In the **Buckets** list, select the bucket configured for static website hosting.
3. Go to the **Permissions** tab.
4. Under **Block public access (bucket settings)**, click **Edit**.
5. Uncheck **Block all public access** and choose **Save changes**.

#####‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:**  
Disabling Block Public Access allows anyone on the internet to access your bucket. Make sure you understand the security implications before proceeding.

### üìú **Step 2: Add a Bucket Policy for Public Access**

To make the objects in your bucket publicly readable, you need to apply a bucket policy that grants `s3:GetObject` permission.

1. In the **S3 console**, navigate to the **Permissions** tab of your bucket.
2. Under **Bucket Policy**, click **Edit**.
3. Paste the following bucket policy, replacing `Bucket-Name` with your actual bucket name:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### üìú **Step 3: Click the URL**
   - Your website URL is under the **Proporties** tab of your S3 Bucket under **Static Website**
